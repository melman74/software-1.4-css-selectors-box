                I've enjoyed train travel since my first trip on a passenger train as a small child. I enjoy traveling on Amtrak in the US, VIA rail in Canada, and all the various rail lines throughout Europe.  I especially enjoy the Eurostar service through the Channel Tunnel from London to Brussels and Paris.

                My interests in Genealogy and History go hand in hand. Genealogy is simply my personal family history.  My ancestry is German, Scottish, and Native American.  My great-grandfather migrated to America in the 1870s from an area that is now Poland but was part of East Prussia when he came to the US.

            <p>Hi everyone!
                Although my given name is Jeffrey, only my mother ever used that name whenever I had done something very wrong!
                Please call me Jeff instead. You can reach my Github <a href="https://github.com/melman74">here.</a> 
                I am from Chicago, Illinois, USA.  I work in information technology at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
                I am experienced in dealing with data and databases, especially Oracle.
